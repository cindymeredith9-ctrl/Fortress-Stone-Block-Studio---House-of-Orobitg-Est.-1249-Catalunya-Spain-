### 3. TECHNICAL/VERCEL ISSUES 🟡

#### **Environment Variables**
Current: NONE configured

You'll likely need:
```bash
# .env (create this file)
VITE_WHOP_CLIENT_ID=your_whop_client_id
VITE_WHOP_API_KEY=your_whop_api_key
VITE_APP_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
```

Add to Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to: Project Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add each variable for Production, Preview, Development

#### **PDF Generation Library** ⚠️
- [ ] You have PDF export screens but NO PDF library installed
- [ ] Install one of:

- [ ] User authentication (Auth0, Clerk, or Supabase Auth)
- [ ] Project save/sync across devices
- [ ] Cloud backup for estimates

### 4. TRADEMARK REGISTRATION 🟠

  - COPYRIGHT.md
  - CopyrightFooter component
  - All export PDFs
  - Marketing materials
- [ ] Consider provisional vs. full utility patent

## 🚀 VERCEL DEPLOYMENT CONCERNS

### **Will It Deploy?** ✅ YES (with warnings)

Your app WILL deploy successfully to Vercel, but with these issues:

### 🟢 WORKS FINE
- [x] React + Vite build
- [x] Routing (SPA with rewrites configured)
- [x] Static assets
- [x] CSS/Tailwind
- [x] All UI components
- [x] Logo and images (Figma assets)
- [x] All installed npm packages

### 🟡 WORKS BUT INCOMPLETE
- ⚠️ **Whop Checkout**: Opens placeholder URLs (need real Whop URLs)
- ⚠️ **PDF Export**: UI works but actual PDF generation will fail
- ⚠️ **localStorage**: Data doesn't sync across devices
- ⚠️ **No Analytics**: Can't track users (consider Vercel Analytics)

### 🔴 LEGAL RISKS
- ❌ **No Terms of Service**: Users can't legally agree to use
- ❌ **No Privacy Policy**: Violates privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA)
- ❌ **No Liability Disclaimer**: HUGE risk for construction app
- ❌ **No Professional Engineer Disclaimer**: Could be sued

## ⚡ VERCEL-SPECIFIC ISSUES TO WATCH

### 1. Build Size
- Your app is large (many components)
- Should be fine, but monitor build logs
- Vercel free tier: 6,000 build minutes/month

### 2. Image Optimization
- Figma assets use `figma:asset` scheme
- This works with Vite but may not optimize on Vercel
- Consider converting to standard imports if images are large

### 3. Function Timeouts
- You don't have serverless functions (yet)
- If you add database later, watch 10-second timeout on free tier

### 4. Environment Variables
- You have NONE currently
- When you add Whop API keys, add them in Vercel Dashboard
- Don't commit `.env` to Git!

### 5. Domain Setup
- Vercel provides: `your-app.vercel.app`
- Custom domain: Need to configure DNS
- HTTPS: Automatic with Vercel
