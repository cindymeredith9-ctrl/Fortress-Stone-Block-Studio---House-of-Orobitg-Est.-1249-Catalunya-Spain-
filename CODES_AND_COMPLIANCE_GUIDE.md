# 2. BUILDING CODES (Legal Compliance)

## **WHAT ARE BUILDING CODES?**

### **DEFINITION:**
```
Building codes = Government regulations that ensure buildings are safe

Main codes in USA:
• IBC (International Building Code) - Commercial
• IRC (International Residential Code) - Residential
• IMC (International Mechanical Code) - HVAC
• IPC (International Plumbing Code) - Plumbing
• NEC (National Electrical Code) - Electrical
• Plus local city/county amendments
```

### **DO YOU NEED TO INCLUDE THEM IN YOUR APP?**

```
❌ NO - You don't code the full building code into your app
❌ NO - You don't need to know every building code
❌ NO - You don't certify code compliance

✅ YES - You need DISCLAIMERS (already done!)
✅ YES - You need to say "hire a Professional Engineer"
✅ YES - You need to say "comply with local codes"
```

### **✅ ALREADY COVERED IN YOUR APP:**

```
Your ENGINEERING_DISCLAIMERS.md file says:

"This system must comply with all applicable building codes including:
   • International Building Code (IBC)
   • International Residential Code (IRC)
   • Local amendments and jurisdiction-specific requirements
   • Seismic, wind, and snow load requirements for your region"

"Professional Engineer Review REQUIRED"

"Building Permits REQUIRED"
```

**→ THIS PROTECTS YOU LEGALLY!!**

### **WHAT CONTRACTORS NEED TO DO:**

```
Contractor's responsibility (NOT YOURS!):
1. Hire Professional Engineer (PE)
2. PE designs to meet local codes
3. PE stamps/seals plans
4. Submit to building department
5. Building department reviews
6. Issues permit (or requests revisions)
7. Construction begins
8. Inspections during construction
9. Final inspection
10. Certificate of Occupancy issued

YOU are NOT part of this process!
You just license the system and provide specs.
```

# 3. PROMOTIONAL DISCOUNT CODES (Marketing)

## **FOR HOMEOWNER SUBSCRIPTIONS**

### **EXAMPLE PROMO CODES:**

```
LAUNCH2026     = 20% off first 3 months
VETERAN25      = 25% off for veterans
BUILDER50      = 50% off for licensed contractors
REFER10        = $10 off for referrals
BLACKFRIDAY    = 50% off annual plans
```

### **HOW TO IMPLEMENT (WHOP):**

```
Whop handles this automatically!

1. Log into Whop Dashboard
2. Go to "Discount Codes"
3. Create new code:
   - Code: LAUNCH2026
   - Discount: 20%
   - Valid for: 30 days
   - Max uses: 100
4. Share code with customers
5. Whop applies discount automatically!
```

### **DO YOU NEED CODES IN YOUR APP?**

```
NO - Whop handles all discount codes for subscriptions

Your app just needs:
- "Subscribe" button
- Links to Whop checkout URLs
- Whop handles coupons, discounts, billing
```

---

# 4. QR CODES (Physical Products)

## **OPTIONAL BUT POWERFUL**

### **WHERE TO USE QR CODES:**

```
📦 On block pallets:
QR Code → Scans to block specs PDF

📄 On marketing materials:
QR Code → Scans to your app download

🏗️ On finished buildings:
QR Code → Scans to "Built with Fortress Stone™" page

```

### **HOW TO GENERATE QR CODES:**

```
FREE TOOLS:
1. QR Code Generator (qr-code-generator.com)

# 5. API KEYS & INTEGRATION CODES

## **DO YOU NEED API KEYS?**

- SendGrid API key (for emails): SG.abc123...
```

### **FOR YOUR APP - DO YOU NEED THEM?**

**❌ NOT REQUIRED:**
```
Your app works 100% without API keys!
Everything runs in the browser (localStorage)
No external services required
```

**✅ OPTIONAL - FOR ADVANCED FEATURES:**

```
IF you want to add later:

1. EMAIL AUTOMATION (SendGrid/Mailgun):
   - Auto-send license codes
   - Royalty report reminders
   - Marketing emails
   Cost: ~$15-50/month

2. PAYMENT PROCESSING (Stripe):
   - Accept payments directly in app
   - Instead of Whop
   Cost: 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction

3. PDF GENERATION (PDF.co):
   - Generate PDFs on server
   - Instead of browser
   Cost: ~$20/month

4. SMS NOTIFICATIONS (Twilio):
