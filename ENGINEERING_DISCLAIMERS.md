## **Wall Builder Warning:**

```
⚠️ ENGINEERING REVIEW REQUIRED

The calculations provided are ESTIMATES ONLY based on ideal conditions.

Your actual project requires:
• Professional engineer review and structural calculations

```
💰 COST ESTIMATES ARE APPROXIMATIONS

Actual project costs may vary significantly due to:
• Regional material pricing
• Labor rates in your area  
• Site conditions and accessibility
• Market fluctuations
• Additional requirements discovered during construction

Always obtain multiple bids from licensed contractors before proceeding.
